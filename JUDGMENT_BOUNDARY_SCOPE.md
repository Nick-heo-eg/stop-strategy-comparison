This project intentionally defines judgment boundaries, not judgment ownership. It does not provide legal-grade refusal artifacts, sealed authority, proprietary judgment runtimes, or court-admissible claims. Responsibility for final decisions explicitly remains external to this system (human, organizational, or institutional). This repository is reference-only and non-normative, focused on pre-execution stopping structures, fail-closed handling of unknown cases, and negative-proof observability.
